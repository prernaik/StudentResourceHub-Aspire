# ðŸ“˜ Student Resource Hub

**A web platform for Goaâ€™s engineering students where students and teachers can share and access academic resources in one centralized platform.
Currently, students often have to search for notes from seniors, ask in multiple WhatsApp groups, or browse random sources. Our platform solves this by making all study materials easily accessible, well-organized, and verified.**
